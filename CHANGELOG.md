# Change Log

## [0.2.5] - 2022-11-10

## Changed
- Bump Minimum Supported Rust Version to 1.64.0
- Switch from `failure` to `anyhow`
- Performance enhancements:
    - Use `Cow` keys for `UnionSet` and `CountedSet` so we can borrow the lines of
      the first file rather than allocating them
    - If `line` is in a `CountedSet`, don't allocate a key
    - Use `FxHash` â€” averages 10-15% faster on large files
    - Convert `Diff` and `Union` to use `CowSet`
    - Convert `Single`, `Multiple`, and `Intersect` to by-line algorithms
    - No longer create map/set for args after the 1st
- Refactor and expand internal documentation.
- Change Single/Multiple code to use a single NonZeroUsize operand ID rather than
  two u32 IDs

## [0.2.0] - 2021-07-03

## Changed
- Zet looks for Byte Order Marks in UTF-8, UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE files,
  translating UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE to UTF-8. It outputs a (UTF-8) Byte Order
  Mark if and only if it finds one in its first file argument.
- Zet strips off the line terminator (`\n` or `\r\n`) from each input line. On
  output, it uses the line terminator found in the first line of its first file
  argument (or `\n` if the first file consists of a single line with no
  terminator).
